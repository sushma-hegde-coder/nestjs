Rest API - overfetching or underfetching
           /product            --> gives all products    -take product id and give it to next query                           
           /product/id         --> one product but all fields
           
GraphQL - when Rest API becomes smart it becomes GraphQL
          graph - our queries are now able to crawl into the Rest API and pick up the selective information
