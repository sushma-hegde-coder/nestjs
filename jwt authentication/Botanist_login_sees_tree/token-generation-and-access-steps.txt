use Passportjs- gives different strategies to use in your application, it will not give any login facility.
      gives facility to not break your head on logic, which url is private, compare token using secrete key, decode it, storing it in locals
      
strategy is a functionality applicable for entire application like a middleware
      
Token - all necessary info of token like expiration time --2 ways
             either enter it in sign(options...) 
             or define it globally....wherever jwt is signed, this configuration will be taken automatically
             
only command line tools should be installed gloabally all others should be locally installed, if you install something globally,it will not work in your application still you have to install inside your application locally
commands like nest are global commands, any kind of functionality you are using inside application, it has to be installed in each application separately. Yarn does it in a better way. It caches it, it will not download from internet next time
.
strategy is like a middleware, we need to create strategies
strategy is a serivce, you have to register in providers

Guard is a service, register 
if you want all routes of tree(product) to be protected use @UseGuards

ttl : in min

only dist folder will be deployed
